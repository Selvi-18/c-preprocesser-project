# c-preprocesser-project

o	A custom C preprocessor replicates key functionalities of a standard C preprocessor, including file inclusion, comment removal, macro replacement, and conditional compilation. These operations prepare source code for compilation by integrating headers, cleaning comments, substituting macros, and managing code based on conditional directives, ensuring cleaner and more adaptable code.
